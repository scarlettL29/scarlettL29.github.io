      <p> Once upon a time, there lived a happy penguin couple. Their names were Pih and Puh. They were engaged.</p>
     <p> Pih had very large eyes, a Santa hat, and always wore a suit. Puh, the bride, bought a gorgeous white dress for her wedding.</p>
     <p>  She had a tiara with a jewel at the top instead of a veil. She also had bangs and wavy hair. She was nervous for her wedding though.</p>
     <p>Puh had three bridemaids. They were named Pah, Peh, and Pough. One of the guests at the wedding was named Crisisa. She was the </p>
     <p> ringbearer. On the day of the wedding. Puh had second thoughts. She did npt want to marry Pih! She wanted to live alone. She actually</p>
    <p>  realized that she hated Pih! </p>
