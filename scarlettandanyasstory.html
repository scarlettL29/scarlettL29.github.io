      <p> Once upon a time, there lived a happy penguin couple. Their names were Pih and Puh. They were engaged.</p>
     <p> Pih had very large eyes, a Santa hat, and always wore a suit. Puh, the bride, bought a gorgeous white dress for her wedding.</p>
     <p>  She had a tiara with a jewel at the top instead of a veil. She also had bangs and wavy hair. She was nervous for her wedding though.</p>
     <p>Puh had three bridemaids. They were named Pah, Peh, and Pough. One of the guests at the wedding was named Crissisa. She was the </p>
     <p> ringbearer. On the day of the wedding, Puh had second thoughts. She did not want to marry Pih! She wanted to live alone. She actually</p>
    <p>  realized that she hated Pih! Overcome with emotions Puh ran to Crissisa's room, and hoped to find some comfort with her bestie. </p>
    <p> Howevery she was brutally awakened, when she saw Crissisa's huge pear shaped bottom falling out of the window.</p>
    <p>Puh's eyes widened when she saw he and Pih's diamond wedding-bands squished under the lumpy pile of Crissisa. </p>
